# Transfer-Assest-Block-chain-Application


                           BANK TRANSACTION  APPROVAL  PROCESSING BY USING BLOCK-CHAIN TECHNOLOGY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Problem
-----------------------------
in current situation the bank transaction approval processing is only handle by one people or may be two/three people
we are removing this Centralization approval concept and bring DECENTRALIZATION TECNOLOGY here.
in which every transaction approval is need a group of people for approval.
-----------------------------
                                          Motivation Behind the project: 
---------------------------------------
To maintain the Transparencey in banking system
-------------------------------------

                                       Technology we are using in this project:

Hyper-ledger Fabric( A private block-chain Framework)                       //Means it can only Limited to the Bank authority   
consensus Algortithm that we are using Here is Proof of voting .           //Means Approval is required from every bank authority
Consensus Algorithm proof of Elapsed time is also use        // Means Every Transaction request have set a particular time period
smart contract here is based on Hardware Implementation mean   // spcific Hardware implementaion like Mac Address and Login cred.

--------------------------------------
                                           What we are doing in this project:
-------------------------------------
Here we are providing a public key and private key to all Delegates and Government peers who have an permission of Accessing Database.
-->public key is accessible by all other bank authoity 
-->private key is the secret key of all bank authority that is not shareable.

------------------------------------
                                                      Solution
when Any Bank manager / Any bank higher authority receive a request from any person that have an Any kind of assest problem,.
Then he must need to generate a request and need to share that request into the network
that is regualated by a group of people.

 when a group of people approval that request then transaction is possible other wise not possible 
if transaction is not possible a msg is to be generated and inform to that person who request for assest or money.
